SafeMath

Instructions:

1. Navigate to Remix, and create a new file called `ArcadeTokenSafeMath.sol`. Copy the contents of this activityâ€™s starter file into Remix to help you get started.

2. Add the following import statement just below the pragma and above the contract definition:

  ```solidity
import "github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v2.5.0/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol";
```

3. Define a smart contract called `ArcadeToken`.

4. Add the following as the first line of code in your smart contract:

  ```solidity
  using SafeMath for uint;
  ```

 > **Note** This statement will link the SafeMath library to the `uint` type, allowing you to call `.add`, `.sub`, `.mul`, `.div`, etc. directly from a `uint`, rather than using `&plus;`, `&minus;`, `*`, and `/`.

5. Replace every math operation in the contract with the SafeMath equivalent. For example, the following code:

  ```solidity
  balances[msg.sender] -= value;
  ```

becomes:

  ```solidity
  balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(value);
  ```

6. Deploy and test your contract. You should now be safe from any integer underflows and overflows!

> **Hint** Remember to include the variable reassignments&mdash;SafeMath will not mutate the variable it is operating on. You must reassign the variable with an `=`. For example: `balances[recipient] = balances[recipient].add(value);`.
